This is a tarot journal app I made using Ruby and Sinatra. 
It allows you to get a new tarot deal every day as well as upload photos and embed youtube links into the journal. 
It's my first sinatra project, i'm still learning. To launch navigate your terminal to the folder and use the command

ruby -I lib app.rb

then navigate your browser to http://localhost:4567/
